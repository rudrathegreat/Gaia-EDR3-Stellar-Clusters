## Installing Relevant Libraries

To make sure that you have the relevant python libraries for the source code to run, download `requirements.txt` and then run the following command in the terminal - 

```Bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
If that does not work, then maybe try the following - 

```Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
